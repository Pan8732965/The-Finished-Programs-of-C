## ✔️Better Calculator introduction.🖩
Let me introduce the first work here❗  
Fist this program is called "Better Calculator". Why I called this name? Because it can get the "%"number.  
Also it contains the operators of "+,-,*,/.%".But a bad thing is that C can't make a gui to go with this program.Or there is other way that I don't know.❓
### 🛠 The process of the calculator program
In this program,I use switch statements for the main using and use do while to ensure the user to use this calculator or not.  
Besides I take this program for reference on [here](https://www.includehelp.com/c-programs/calculator-using-switch.aspx?fbclid=IwAR1Bf5CgWmm88EegSnhegBDyRw_NSQem6U2cyz3asBvLkf3hGh4bNoqZvq4)
.  
**But i just take reference.I don't all copy from this,i also do some changes of this code as you compare the code with between mine and his.**  
Pictures below:
