    # The-Finished-Programs-of-C
This repo includes every finished c programs that code by myself and the files that i take reference.
## ✔️Better Calculator introduction.🖩
Let me introduce my first work here❗  
Fist this program is called "Better Calculator". Why I called this name? Because it can get the "%"number.  
Also it contains the operators of "+,-,*,/.%".But a bad thing is that C can't make a gui to go with this program.Or there is other way that I don't know.❓
### 🛠 The process of the calculator program
In this program,I use switch statements for the main using and use do while to ensure the user to use this calculator or not.  
Besides I take this program for reference on [here](https://www.includehelp.com/c-programs/calculator-using-switch.aspx?fbclid=IwAR1Bf5CgWmm88EegSnhegBDyRw_NSQem6U2cyz3asBvLkf3hGh4bNoqZvq4)
.  
**But i just take reference.I don't all copy from this,i also do some changes of this code as you compare the code with between mine and his.**  
Pictures below:
1. The switch statement that I use:

## ✔️Guessing Game introduction🎮
Let me introduce my first game here❗  
As the name said.This is a "simple" program can let users play guessing game.I added some interesting elements in here just to provide users a more intuitively environment.  
Also I provided two languages(english and traditional chinese)to give two playing feelings in this game:
> English:

> Chinese:

⚠️Chinese users:When you want to compiler please use big5,and use UTF-8 when editing.  
Otherwise;you can't read it.
In the end,hope you guys enjoy this game.📣
### 🛠 The process of the Guessing Game program
In this program,I mainly use function to simplify my code(that is a big help for me).And use lots of different functions to make the program better.  
For example:
1. do while:

width="702" height="200" />
2. time(to make the number is actually random):

3. functions(helping me printing line.✍️):

And lots of...

In the end,I especially like this Loading effect.  
This is a cool effect can actually take users into the game.👇
